<h1>
    Hello everyone
</h1>

<!-- 
    if we made any changes in the vs code then it will not be added into the github...untill we add it.
    so to add it we will use commands like
        -git add (file name) by this it will add all the modified file or new file.
        -git add . we can use this command if there are so many files to be added

    then we will use another command
        -git commit -m "write what you have changed" 

    then we will push it into the origin by the command
        -git push origin main

    after this steps your all modified files or added files will be added in your github
-->
<!-- and to check the status which file is added or not we can use the command git status -->
